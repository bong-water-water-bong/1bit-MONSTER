# 1bit.MONSTER

<sub>**One engine. Any model. Zero Python.**</sub>

A model-agnostic, hardware-agnostic, pure-C++26 inference engine — MIT licensed.
One binary that runs Hugging Face models on **NPU + GPU + CPU**. 16 model families,
the native **1BP** format, and **JARVIS** (the flagship voice assistant) all inside
`build/1bit`.

100% HF model coverage, any hardware. An open-source, pure-C++ inference engine.
NPU + GPU + CPU in one engine. Zero Python. MIT.

### The lines

- **One engine, any model** — detects the architecture and picks a kernel path. No config, no glue.
- **Zero Python** — pure C++26. No virtualenv, no pip, nothing to babysit. Source to model in three commands.
- **The NPU story** — AMD's closed XDNA 2 stack, 22 proprietary libraries, was reverse-engineered in four days. And now it beats it.

### Hardware targets

| Backend | Notes |
|---|---|
| **NPU** | XDNA 2 DPU kernels, Q4NX / 1BP, 64 MB SRAM |
| **GPU** | HIP (ROCm) + Vulkan, fused MoE shaders |
| **CPU** | scalar + OpenMP fallbacks |

One binary, every backend. `build/1bit` is the engine, the serving server, the CLI, and the voice assistant.

### Model coverage

16 documented families: `qwen`, `llama`, `deepseek`, `gemma`, `mistral`, `phi`,
`olmo`, `gpt-oss`, `falcon`, `granite`, `kimi`, `laguna`, `bitnet-bonsai`,
`smollm`, `whisper`, `zyphra`. The **Zyphra** family is the one the engine was
tuned against and powers JARVIS by default.

### Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/1bit-MONSTER/1bit-MONSTER && cd 1bit-MONSTER
bash install.sh            # build
bash install.sh --with-jarvis   # build + JARVIS launcher + config

./build/1bit zaya               # serve on :8088
./build/1bit zaya --port 8080   # custom port
```

### The site

This repo hosts the **1bit.MONSTER marketing site** — a self-contained static
site (no build step, no dependencies), designed in a modern-minimal light system
with a 1-bit pixel identity.

### Design system

- **Light modern-minimal ground** — near-white background, ink type, hairline structure.
- **Theme modes** — **light** (default) / **auto** (follows the OS) / **dark**, via the
  segmented switch in the top nav. Choice persists in `localStorage` (`1bit-theme`);
  `theme.js` in `<head>` applies it before first paint so there is no flash.
  Dark mode swaps the oklch tokens per page and pins the intentionally inverted
  pieces (ink console screens, merch plates) to their light-design values.
  Regenerate on every page with `python3 scripts/site_theme_modes.py`.

- **1-bit pixel identity** — the relay mark, crisp pixel art, one blue accent + one status green.
- **Type** — system display sans + system body; mono for numerics, labels, micro-labels.
