# Vendored: lemonade-sdk/lemonade (embedded server core)

Vendored from https://github.com/lemonade-sdk/lemonade at commit
`2b6a7d77c71e551736f6cc8473dc46f479cd156b` (tag `v11.7.0`).

Vendored (instead of a submodule) because the embedded server core needs a
patch that only exists locally, and CI can't fetch unpublished submodule
SHAs. Re-vendor on upstream sync:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/lemonade-sdk/lemonade /tmp/lemonade
cd /tmp/lemonade
git checkout 2b6a7d77c71e551736f6cc8473dc46f479cd156b  # v11.7.0
# re-apply the embeddability patch below
rsync -a --exclude=.git /tmp/lemonade/ third_party/lemonade/
```


## Local patch: embedded dependency compatibility (v11.8.0 additions)

Beyond the embeddability patch above, v11.8.0's CMakeLists needs three more
local edits to build as a subdirectory of the 1bit engine (all no-op or
inert when built standalone):

1. **Existing-target detection for deps**: `find_package(nlohmann_json)` /
   `pkg_check_modules(HTTPLIB)` are wrapped in `if(TARGET nlohmann_json)` /
   `if(TARGET httplib)` — when the engine has already FetchContent'd them, treat
   them as system so v11.8.0 doesn't fetch a second copy and collide on the
   `add_library(nlohmann_json)` / `add_library(httplib)` target names.
2. **`add_test` override gated on BUILD_TESTING**: v11.8.0 replaces `add_test`
   with a global FATAL_ERROR function, which poisons every later `add_test()` in
   a parent build. The override is now inside `if(BUILD_TESTING)` (the engine
   builds with BUILD_TESTING=OFF, so the builtin stays).
3. **zstd supplied when the target is missing**: the engine's `cpp_httplib`
   links `zstd::libzstd`; the old vendored lemonade was the only provider of
   that target. The FetchContent gate is now
   `if(NOT USE_SYSTEM_ZSTD OR NOT TARGET zstd::libzstd)`.
## Local patch: embeddability

`CMakeLists.txt` carries one local patch (see the "Embedding" comment near
`lemonade-server-core`):

1. `CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR` → `CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR` everywhere — no-op when
   built standalone, fixes packaging paths when built as a subdirectory of
   the 1bit-monster repo via `add_subdirectory`.
2. Treat the parent's FetchContent-provided `nlohmann_json` and `httplib`
   targets as "system" deps (`USE_SYSTEM_JSON` / `USE_SYSTEM_HTTPLIB` set ON
   when `TARGET nlohmann_json` / `TARGET httplib` exist) so the vendored tree
   does not FetchContent a second copy and collide on target names. The
   `lemonade-httplib` interface target short-circuits to link the parent's
   `httplib` target directly when it exists.
3. PUBLIC include dirs on `lemonade-server-core` so parent targets
   (`unified_server`, `unified_router`) linking the OBJECT library see
   `lemon/` headers + generated headers (upstream uses a subdirectory-local
   `include_directories()` that does not propagate to consumers).

Drop the patch when upstream adopts any of these changes.
